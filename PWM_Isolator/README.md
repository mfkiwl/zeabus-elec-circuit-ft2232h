# Zeabus-Elec-PWM_Isolator
A logic isolator coupled between the Pololu RC controller and motor drivers. The specifications are:

1. Use __Si8660BA-B-IS1__ (Narrow SOIC package) as the isolator. The reason of choosing this type of isolator is low current consumption.
2. Support 12 Channels of PWM signal.
2. The board should have the same size as Pololu Maestro 12-Channel RC Servo Controller and be able to plug to the Pololu as an add-on.
3. VDD1 is taken directly from Pololu
4. VDD2 is selectable from one of the 12 motor drivers.
